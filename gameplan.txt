@ learning stage --> 
	1. run reinforcement learning to determine weights and
		features for eval function

@ registerInitialState() --> 
	1. run particle filtering until we reach a certain 
		probability threshold
	2. then, we can do something else

@ chooseAction() -->
	1. update particles (for a little bit)
	2. based on highest prob, run expectimax for a certain amount of time
		(cutoff test is not based on computation time)
	3. update reinforcement model with regular Q learning
